playing retro videogames on emulators (And the original hardware!): from sprite-based machines, to more complex, 3D-capable monsters.\nMetal Slug, an impressive 2D game; developed for SNK's Neo-Geo\nA few years ago, I started to ask myself how an emulator works; I initially believed it had to be some sort of magic, but at the end of the day, code is just that, code (Technically, you can develop an emulator from an ECE-perspective; look up Verilog or really, any Hardware-Description-Language, but that's beyond the scope for this post).\nWhat is an emulator?\nLet's start by defining what an emulator (Not to be confused with simulator) really is.\nAccording to Wikipedia:\nThe key takeaway here, is the ability to run code that is designed for one system on another one.\nExamples of this could be, running aarch64 code on your shiny new Intel/AMD PC (Playing a videogame designed for Android, for example); the technique Apple employs for their newer M-line of processors (Which are 64-bit ARM chips) but they are able to maintain backwards compatibility to a degree with macOS software designed for their older Intel machines (And doing so in a fast and efficient manner, using Rosetta 2)...\nBut how can we, as individuals, tackle this problem?\nWell, there's lots of ways of doing so.\nTypes of emulation\nThe following paragraph contains information about a type of emulators that have lately emerged; they're more state-of-the-art in comparison with good-old already-existing emulators, it's meant to illustrate, it can be confusing for newbies so you can skip to the HLE vs LLE chapter if you want.\nA brief paragraph: As of recent times, a new way to experience retro systems has appeared, not to confuse you, but I'll give a brief explanation as to what FPGA-based emulation is and not.\nFPGAs are integrated circuits whose behaviour can be repgrogrammed at the logic level after manufacturing, they can be programmed using HDL's (Hardware description languages) which goes through a series of steps before getting executed by the development board.\nThe Xilinx Spartan FPGA\nWhat this basically means is, that you can effectively replicate any existing chip on an FPGA.\nIn comparison with traditional emulators (Which, run on top of an operating system), FPGA-based emulators have a bunch of neat advantages due do the nature of the technology itself.\nFor example, operating systems tend not to give you a fine-grained scheduling; let's say your emulator wants to handle keypad inputs; you need to somehow interact with the underlying OS to perform such task, but the OS itself can then assign the priority it sees fitting so the latency (Normally in miliseconds) can fluctuate making accurate emulation really difficult. Worth mentioning, that normally, the more accurate it needs to be, the more power-hungry the emulator will end up.\nFPGAs benefit from the parallelism they can archieve due to their nature, and also can maintain the components clocked much more accurately again, due to their nature; doing so while not requiring as much power as a normal, PC emulator.\nAnyhow, back to the main topic.\nHLE vs LLE\nThere's two ways to understand emulation; and this varies by the level of closeness to the hardware you decide to entangle yourself with.\nLLE\nLLE stands for Low-level Emulation. What this means is, closely replicating the target hardware at the bare-metal level.\nYou must emulate every bit of the system to make it work; that means implementing a CPU core that can execute the foreign instructions; providing an interface for it to send/recieve data to/from peripherals and respecting the timings of all the components to make it as accurate as possible (You can read further on this topic if you look up Cycle Accuracy).\nHLE\nHLE on the other hand, can be understood as a MITM between the target library calls and mapping them to host-compatible ones; let's say we have System A which, somewhere on it's code, does this:\nIf we're trying to HLE System A, we need to figure out a way to first, detect that this function is being called (Normally, there's a piece of code responsible for intercepting, for example, syscalls) and instead of executing the target code, executing a function written for the host architecture that archieves the same but without relying on the target-specific hardware details.\nWe could for example, intercept it and call the following code in a PC:\nAnd that's the basic principle behind HLE. You also need a way to intercept those library calls; for example, let's say we're interpreting target (System A) CPU instructions, and suddenly, we encounter a syscall instruction.\nLet's assume this syscall instruction in System A works by specifying the syscall type on register A and the required arguments on registers B and C.\nImagine we find this:\nThis basically would call syscall number 3 on the syscall table, which, for example, could be our previously explained libGfxInitFramebuffer().\nYou'd then need to detect this behaviour whilst executing the target code, intercept it and redirect execution and adjust the emulation state accordingly (Maybe adjusting cycle count to account for the original length of the syscall function... etc).\nIt's also important to note, that nowadays (Moreso with more recent consoles), there's a trend to mix both LLE and HLE techniques to get thehe benefits of both approaches. There's some components that you can HLE to reduce the processing hurdle of more complex subsystems a machine can have.\nDefining the target\nNow that we finally have laid down the concepts related to emulation; let's find a target that has a CPU that has a relatively easy implementation in software.\nWe'll focus for example on the Amstrad GX4000. A 3rd generation, PAL home console that was launched in the 80s.\nThe Amstrad GX4000\nThe specs are very straightforward; an 8-bit Zilog Z80A at 4 MHz a custom chip that handled sprites, Sound DMAs and Interrupts.\nSound-wise; a 3-channel stereo, AY-3-8912 chip.\nAs for space, 64 KiB of RAM, 16 KiB of Video RAM and 32 KiB of ROM.\nReally simple.\nWe'll focus on CPU emulation and we'll ignore the rest of the peripherals for now.\nEmulation loop\nOnce you find the detailed specs for the machine you want to target; it's time to work.\nThe usual recommendation is to find on the Internet as much documentation as you can; but depending on the target, you may find less stuff; so be prepared to reverse-engineer if needed.\nFor the major players in the market, there's popular resources online that give a very detailed explanation of the entire system; but again, your mileage may vary.\nThe basics for emulating a CPU are, knowing how a CPU works, here's a pretty simple diagram:\nThe fetch-decode-execute cycle\nBasically, we need to fetch data from the memory, decode it and execute it; profit.\n2 simple steps!\nIn all seriousness; it's really that simple¹\n¹.- Depending on the CPU, it may be less simple (Think of possible address modes, the straightforward-ness of the opcode decoding, the pipeline it may have, the timings...)\nLet's get down\nCPU emulation techniques\nInterpreter\nWe'll start with the more easier type of technique; an Interpreter.\nLet's have some pseudocode explain the rest, we'll do some assumptions that don't map to the real Z80A, to simplify the explanation and the code (We assume opcode size == 1 byte, no addressing modes, no banked register set...):\nThis is the skeleton for an emulator; think of the PC (Program Counter, sometimes also called IP, Instruction Pointer) register as a pointer to memory from where we'll read instructions from.\nNormally, the PC then will get incremented by 1 at the end of the opcode processing (But some opcodes that handle PC relocation, such as JUMPs or CALLs may add an offset to it or straight up setting it to a determinate value).\nIn reality, PC will increment sizeof(opcode), but there may be some exceptions to that in some architectures; be always mindful when designing the main loop.\nAnd that's it, you've just designed a primitive interpreter loop.\nThis is one of the many ways to implement the fetch-decode-execute loop; and one of the slowest ones too; think the amount of instructions per second you need to decode and execute in 8MHz's worth of time.\nIt adds up.\nCached Interpreter\nSo far we've covered the basis for an Interpreter; but there's other techniques to gain an advantage, speed-wise.\nFor instance, you could cache the instructions you're translating in blocks so that it alleviates the fetch-decode hotspot a bit; as it'd only need to process it once (Ignoring that code can be self-modifying and in that case you'd need to invalidate and recompile the affected block; but that's for another day).\nDynamic Recompiler\nBy far, one of the most efficient ways to tackle emulation is by developing a Dynamic Recompiler (Just-in-Time compiler); which interprets the target, arch-uncompatible instructions; and translates them to host instructions. For example, Rosetta 2 converts x86_64 instructions to aarch64 ones and runs them in a efficient and fast manner.\nIt's one of the most complex ones, but also, one of the most rewarding ones; there's several challenges to tackle when developing a Dynamic Recompiler; such as deciding how to to the actual recompilation:\nDo we want an emitter that directly translates the instructions? Maybe we want instead to use some sort of IL (Intermediate language) so that a compiler backend (Think, LLVM) can introduce code optimizations and do the translation? How do we handle self-modifying code? And what about register spilling (Imagine targetting an arch that has more registers than your host one, you may need to use some stack trickery or another technique to decide the least used registers and swap them into the host ones as needed)?\nAs you can see, there are many more challenges when trying to go the Dynamic Recompilation route; but it's a really interesting path to go down.\nA simple JIT diagram, it also needs a cache for the compiled blocks\nPeripherals\nThere's also the added challenge of handling peripherals; there's cases where you'll find I/O operations CPU-wise that interact with the peripherals on the system; or some other times, they can be memory-mapped.\nIn any case, there's some food for thought involved into deciding the best way to tackle both of the systems.\nA simple, pseudocode example that explains the memory-mapped approach:\nThere's also some other considerations to have; think about how you want to plot graphics; or play audio, or read from a filesystem... there's some design choices to be made in order to properly handle the rest of the system aside from the CPU and presenting it to the user (Or letting him interact with the emulated environment!).\nBonus Track\nAoT\nThere's also a thing called Ahead-of-Time recompilation which, as you have probably already guessed; recompiles the entire target binary before running it to host-compatible machine code.\nIt's not purely emulation, but it's still a form of recompilation; it's incredibly difficult because it shares a problem that Dynamic Recompilators have; self-modifying code. If you AoT recompile a target code but it ends up self modifying, you can end up with some interesting results.\nCredits\nWith all this being said, I hope the reader finds some understanding in what emulation is about!\nFeel free to reach out to me in case you need more resources!\nYou can also join us @ the EmuDev Discord; there's plenty of knowledgeable people that will help you in your journey!","id":"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/how-emulators-work/","title":"How Emulators Work?"},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/hugo-to-zola-migration/":{"body":"To blog or to not blog...\nSo... there's some point in time where you, as a software developer, you may face the urge to go on unedited rants regarding whatever project you\nmay be doing/participating.\nThen you somehow think (\"The collective intellect that resteth in our mortal frames.\", \"Our brain\" from now on)...\nCommunication excerpt\n(Our brain) - Hey, it could be cool to write and document for the posteriority whatever niche thing we may be doing right now.\n(Ours) - Hey, yeah!

It tends to be simple, effective,\nand whilst not super-fast, easy to grasp.\nThe main idea is to define a predefined amount of memory ranges and use a big if-else chain or a big switch.\nThen, based on what each opcode asks for to be accessed, you make the memory handlers check against that value and return\nthe accessed value accordingly:\nCode snippet\nbus.rs:\nThis is for systems that have no MMU, when systems have an MMU, you first have to do the virtual-to-physical\naddress translation to get the physical address so you can properly access the correct memory location.\nThat means that you may need to emulate enough of the MMU to get it to spew the correct PA's (For MIPS-based consoles,\nyou can usually &amp; the high bits and that gives you the PA due to how they \"mirror\" memory).\nSoftware fastmem\nThe main idea behind software fastmem is to have an array of pointers point (duh) whose sole objective is mimicking\na page-table structure.\nThat is, if we were to divide the address space of the target system into pages; we'd have to populate both the read\nand the write arrays with pointers to page-size-aligned entries (For RAM, scratchpad...).\nSo, we'd be effectively \"mapping\" those addresses to our array, simple example (Assuming the pointer array has been built):\nCode snippet\nbus.rs:\nAs you can see, this approach is much, much more faster; since we \"delegate\" the costly part on startup (The actual filling\nof the page table arrays for reads/writes) and then we just have to index the corresponding page entry (Else we assume it's unmapped\nand that means it's usually an IO access for simpler systems or that you may need to update the mappings because a TLB entry was modified f.e.).\nThere's a great article by wheremyfoodat, on which it explains perfectly how to achieve this system.\nSo, this already cuts down lots of the cost of memory addressing, but we still have one more trick on our sleeves.\nHardware fastmem\nOut of all the methods we've already seen, this one was the most difficult one for me to grasp.\nTurns out we can get native-speed (That means, host-level performance) accesses for memory reads/writes for an emulated system.\nThe way to do this is really tied to what Operating System we want to target and how the emulated system's memory subsystem behaves.\nApproach itself should be relatively simple for systems without virtual memory (But you'll have to make some considerations as to how\nworth it is to implement hardware fastmem for simpler systems), but complexity increases based on how target system memory access patterns (Because\none may encounter an MMU and the need to remap memory ranges and that by itself, can become a hassle to do depending on how we tackle it).\nThis system is also really unsuitable for anything that's not a JIT. Since we kind of need to jump to exception handlers, doing this on a per-memory-access\nbasis will tank our performance, so from now on, we'll assume that this is targeted for a dynamic recompiler-based emulator.\nAllocating a virtual memory pool\nFirst and foremost, we need to ask the host operating system for a pool of free and usable virtual memory chunk.\nThe approach varies between Windows and Linux (Other operating systems may also have its own quirks but won't be covered here) varies.\nFor instance, under Linux, one would issue a call to mmap():\nCode snippet\nFor this specific case, we ask the kernel for a chunk of size, mapped wherever it wants (ptr::null_mut()), initially w/o any access to it (PROT_NONE) and\nnot backed by a file, we4 also don't specify a file descriptor (-1) since the second flag we specified to mmap() is MAP_ANONYMOUS. Changes are also private to\nthe process thanks to MAP_PRIVATE.\nThanks to PROT_MODE (Not physically backed with anything) we gain a crucial ability for hardware fastmem (Which we'll explain later), faulting on unmapped accesses.\nFor Windows, we'll use VirtualAlloc2() (Which means that we'll need version Windows 10 v1803 &gt;=, from 2018) because Windows memory management was bound to 64K alignment\nfor legacy reasons.\nCode snippet\nAgain, ptr::null_mut()'s are, in order, to let the kernel choose the base address, and then so we don't specify extended parameters.\nMEM_RESERVE | MEM_RESERVE_PLACEHOLDER, the crucial bit is MEM_RESERVE_PLACEHOLDER, since that's why we use VirtualAlloc2() in the first place.\nThis creates a reservation that can be split and replaced, working around Windows' legacy 64K allocation granularity that made precise memory layout control impossible with the regular VirtualAlloc().\nAnd then, same as with Linux; PAGE_NOACCESS to make unmapped accesses fault.\nFor hardware fastmem, placeholders are essential because you need contiguous virtual address space where different regions map to different backing stores (BootROM, RAM, MMIO...) without being constrained by the legacy 64K granularity of the old model.\nMore valuable information\nAdding mappings\nTo do this under Linux, my way of doing it was using shared memory files. There could be better ways but this one worked for my PS2 Emulator, RustEE.\nFirst, we open a shared memory file:\nCode snippet\nWhen we have the file descriptor for it, we truncate the size of the fd itself; we can use ftruncate() for that:\nCode snippet\n(Worth noting I'm omitting error handling and stuff not to clutter the post with that).\nAfter this, it's a matter of actually adding the mapping to our \"base\" pointer of virtual addresses:\nCode snippet\nThis would suffice to have the region mapped. You can also map R/O regions by doing: PROT_READ instead of PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE (Think\nBootROMs and such).\nIf you need to copy a BootROM/BIOS/proprietary binary over the mapping, you can do it by mmap()-ing (Or the Windows alternative) with PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,\nthen copying the bytes to it and finally remapping it correctly as R/O (Using mprotect()/VirtualProtect/()):\nCode snippet\nOn the Windows side of things, we'll use CreateFileMapping2() to achieve similar results.\nCode snippet\nThis grants us a memory mapped file.\nWe then \"initialize\" the region we'll place the mapping on the pool by issuing a VirtualFree() with a special bit set...\nCode snippet\n...and we map the fd to the virtual address pool using MapViewOfFile3():\nCode snippet\nAgain, if you need to copy any proprietary binary to those sections; the approach is similar to that of Linux's.\nHandling accesses\nThanks to leveraging the host's MMU we can now do memory accesses as follows:\nCode snippet\nAs you can see, this is a vast improvement in comparison with what we had for previous methods.\nSegmentation fault handler\nThis pretty much covers memory-backed regions (RAM, ROM, Scratchpad...) but, what about IO accesses for instance? Or TLB exceptions that\nmay require actually mapping pages or things akin?\nHere come custom signal handlers!\nThe requisite for a JIT for this is explained now, when catching this faults, one can go and patch the emitted memory access machine code (Proven that\nit can be easily identified by heuristics in the case of not being the one responsible for the emission, think LLVM IR or Cranelift; or because you know\nthe exact bytes to look for) by the function call to the slower, IO handler.\nImagine your emulator has to wait some time waiting for some IO stuff to happen; for instance, waiting for a VBlank bit on hardware to be untoggled:\nOn a JIT, it'll patch the load instruction with the io handler and subsequent block executions will be just as fast.\nOn an interpreter, each time the load happens it'll jump to the sighandler... and that's a lot of context switching overhead per many times the load happens per second...\nGeneral flow\nGeneral flow schema for patching the JIT callsite\nThe general idea is to install a signal handler (sigaction() for Linux, AddVectoredExceptionHandler() for Windows) for SIGSEGV (Linux) or look for 0xC0000005 (Windows) exceptions inside the handler.\n(Mix of real and pseudocode from now on!)\nSignal handler installation\nAfter you enter the signal handler, you can retrieve the faulting address (Linux: (*info).si_addr(), Windows: record.ExceptionInformation[1]) and based on your preferred\nmethod of action, patch the access accordingly.\nAt this stage, you may want to try and encapsulate the logic to abstract the OSs underneath. Let's assume you have a per-OS structure.\nFor Linux, we need to install the sighandlers as previously mentioned:\nAnd similarly for Windows, but using AddVectoredExceptionHandler() instead:\nDetecting where and what to patch\nThe objective inside the sighandler, is to patch the JIT callsite that triggered the access fault.\nWhilst there's a few ways of doing so, I chose to have a different set of functions that do the general memory accesses:\nhw_read8(), hw_read16(), hw_write32(), hw_write64()... you get the gist.\nThe main reason as to why I use functions instead of inlining the pointer dereference is mainly because, while you could probably have a trampoline within JIT bounds and take it from there; it felt easier for me, conceptually-speaking; to patch call opcodes instead - so, if the actual pointer dereference fails, we'll be on a \"function boundary\", that is, it'll have it's own stack frame and such and it'll be easier to identify using less-obscure code; at least, personally speaking.\nWhat I do on the handler to figure out then to what memory access the one that triggered the fault belongs; is to, at the start of the emulator, I \"precompute\" the memory ranges of the aforementioned functions (I have a simple array that says: hw_read8() starts X and ends at Y, same for the rest of functions) so it's just a matter of capturing a backtrace of a small amount of frames (After all we should not be much more deep from the original callsite of the JIT) and I check each frame IP against the set of ranges; when I get a match, I immediately know if the access was a read or a write, and the length it tried to use.\nFor each function of the ones above, I also (At startup) disassemble them with Capstone (I traverse in reverse from the function's ret until I find the register order for knowing which registers I have to get values out of to properly call the IO stub). I have to do this because of Rust's ABI (Or lack threreof).\nFor x86_64 it's usually a mov reg, (ptr) so it's easy to distinguish what it's trying to write and where. You can get creative, mine is probably the most hacky solution but reliably works. Else you'd have to generate some sort of trampoline code from within the JIT realm that tries to get all of this on runtime which for my case, was a bit more difficult to grasp around.\nSo I end up building something like:\nAfter we have the registers that hold the values that called the function that faulted, we can now proceed to patching. Again, here you can leave your imagination free as in to how to implement this, but what I do is I just get the IP out of the frame that triggered the fault (That means, effectively, the IP that points to the memory access itself) and you patch that. In my case, since it's a movabs+call pattern, I just modify the movabs address for the IO access one instead of the current hw_readX()/hw_writeX(); if you are the one emitting the assembly this is probably super easy because you don't probably need heuristics to patch the call. But since I rely on Cranelift (And usually has different emission of machine code depending on factors unrelated to the topic) I need a tiny tiny bit of heuristics to detect what I have to patch accurately.\nA simple, visual example:\nAfter patch:\nBe wary that you may need to change the permissions of the page where the machine code resides depending on how (Or the JIT framework) handles those before patching.\nReturning from the exception\nAgain, depending on the method, this may be more convoluted (For instance, I initially tried to parse the stack to find the return address of the function for the JIT call and patched it to re-execute the call but that proved to be difficult due to Cranelift not always doing the same pattern for the call to the general memory handler) so I instead opted for doing the first io call myself manually (Thanks to the registers and stuff I mentioned before) and then just return as usual from exception skipping the instruction that failed (So that it doesn't fault again).\nOnce we have all of this, we're set.\nThere's a myriad more ways of doing this more sanely probably, but this should get you going :)\nResults\nReference:\nWith sw_fastmem on my PS2 emulator (Built with --release) I get on the ballpark of 250~ FPSs.\nThe following image is with hw_fastmem:\n610~ FPSs\nPretty worth.","id":"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/improving-upon-fastmem-techniques/","title":"Hardware Fastmem 101"},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/introducing-pciem/":{"body":"Preface\nPCIem exists solely thanks to countless hours of hacking around Linux (And finding out).

This should be free knowledge and at no cost for anyone wants to try it.\nAuthor (Me, cakehonolulu) wanted to experiment with how much you can twist the untwistable to get this system working and here's the rants and findings about exactly that process.\nFirst of all, why?\nSo, aside from the technical challenge fun of it I also was interested on finding a way of developing drivers inside the host directly.\nFrom my limited knowledge, when we try to look at how companies/groups/whoever try to do PCIe driver development it usually goes in 2 possible ways:\n1.- They don't care about PCIe\nWhich is the sanest way. Honestly if you care about you and your teams sanity this is the way to go. Usually involves building a shim or some sort of abstraction layer that avoids the hassle of going down the driver level to do some general useability tests. This is probably sufficient for everything since there's usually ways to attain more low-levelness if needed.\n2.- They care about PCIe\nThis is great if you care about having as much of the development process covered as possible.\nUsually requires complex co-simulation/co-emulation models. We're talking multiple-people efforts (Maybe even teams) right here.\nSometimes commercial solutions can be used but guess what, they're pricey.\nThere's also SimBricks (Which is open-source and works great!) but if you care a bit about speed and not so much about tight timings it can be costly.\nKnowing this, I kinda wanted to do the full designing of a simple \"dumb framebuffer\" PCIe card (That can do zero-copy DMA and whatnot for it's internal \"VRAM\" in conjunction with the kernel) inside QEMU and get a driver for it; and what a better way of writing a driver than directly on the host.\nYeah, call me crazy.\nProtoPCIem card\nSo, before actually writing drivers, we need to know our target.\nMy idea was an early-to-mid-90s PCI card that had a simple state machine for issuing commands to it and maybe some DMA to speed things up a bit.\nI came up with the following register file:\n0x00 - REG_CONTROL: The main control register for the card; toggling bit 1 (CTRL_RESET) resets the card (Clears status, wipes memory...).\n0x04 - REG_STATUS: R/O status register, STATUS_BUSY (Bit 0) if device is busy; STATUS_DONE (Bit 1), last command executed successfully; STATUS_ERROR, well, an error happened with the last command.\n0x08 - REG_CMD: The command register, writing here starts a command on the card.\n0x0C - REG_DATA: Simple operand for fixed-function operations on the card (Mainly leftover from when designing a much simpler version of PCIem)\n0x10 - REG_RESULT_LO: Low 32-bits of the command result register pair. Probably could do single 64-bit one but again, PoC so I did it like this.\n0x14 - REG_RESULT_HI: High 32-bits of the command result register pair.\n0x20 - REG_DMA_SRC_LO: Low 32-bits of the 64-bit DMA source address of the system memory.\n0x24 - REG_DMA_SRC_HI: High 32-bits \"\" \"\" \"\".\n0x28 - REG_DMA_DST_LO: Low 32-bits of the destination (As offset within the PCI internal memory).\n0x2C - REG_DMA_DST_HI: High 32-bits \"\" \"\" \"\".\n0x30 - REG_DMA_LEN: Length in bytes of the DMA transfer.\nAs for the commands, I have a fixed-function pipeline for now:\nCMD_ADD (0x01): Does REG_DATA + 42\nCMD_MULTIPLY (0x02): Does REG_DATA * 3\nCMD_XOR (0x03): Does REG_DATA ^ 0xABCD1234\nRESERVED (0x04)\nCMD_DMA_FRAME (0x05): Performs DMA transfer basically\nNow that we know the card's definition, I modeled it under QEMU.\nVoodoo 3 PCI card (Voodoo in general served as personal inspiration)\nPCIem (or a speedrun on getting Linus mad)\nI've been experimenting for a while on how to convince Linux's PCI subsystem functions that there's a PCI device attached to the host bus without one being attached. Sounds crazy but I thought it could be something worth experimenting.\nMy initial impression was that I would have to go and hack Linux \"from within\" and have custom kernels and whatnot to have this (Mainly getting rid of sanity checks and whatnot to let this work) but it turns out you can do one trick that'll let you do that from a kernel module w/o ever touching the kernel's source code.\nBut it turns out you can without touching it at all.\nmemmap cmdline argument\nTurns out you can provide a commandline argument to Linux so that it \"reserves\" a physical memory chunk from the \"System RAM\" resource node.\nLet's say your /proc/iomem tells you that your \"System RAM\" node is 0x10000000-0x1FFFFFFF. If we instruct Linux to boot with: memmap=64K$0x1FFEFFFF it'll carve the last 0x10000 and not assign it to \"System RAM\". This means that we have a \"free\" and \"unused\" region we can work with. This is, in part, the root of the mechanism we \"exploit\" for PCIem.\nIt turns out that when the PCI subsystem tries to \"claim\" the region it first checks if it already belongs somewhere (System RAM, other PCI memory...), so by manually carving some of it during boot time we ensure that the PCI subsystem won't complain about it.\nI had 2 other ideas to try and get this working before this approach, main one was doing alloc_pages() and crossing my fingers that it'd work (But it didn't).\nThe second one was much worse, I would manually split one of (If not the only) \"System RAM\" node at runtime (As dangerous as that sounds) and it'd make the memmap requirement not exist at all; but I won't go into the details of why splicing a \"System RAM\" node is a bad idea... (It is)\nAdding a Synthetic PCIe device\nUsing pci_scan_root_bus() and having a specially-prepared struct pci_ops with the read and write handlers containing some cool code makes it so that Linux props up a new PCI device on the bus as if it physically existed there.\nI also use pci_bus_add_devices() and the pci_bus_assign_resources() to populate the card.\nWhen the kernel probes the new device, it ends up calling those functions on the struct; by carefully setting the parameters, we can specify the PCI device properties. From VENDOR_ID to DEVICE_ID, to extended capabilities, to MSI configuration, DMA... and whatnot.\nYou can take a closer look on the source code of pciem.c (vph_read_config(), vph_write_config(), vph_fill_config()).\nBAR remapping\nWhen we have to back the BAR0 memory we can use the carved region from memmap because when it tries to take ownership of it the PCI subsystem won't complain as it won't see it belonging to \"System RAM\" and thus won't return \"-EBUSY\", as we mentioned before.\nThis enables your usual PCIe driver to do \"pci_iomap()\" as if nothing.\n\"ioreadX()\" and \"iowriteX()\" functions also work just fine (Which was kinda expected since it basically works at the memory-barrier levels and whatnot).\nThis is crucial for driver development as it enables us to make them work.\nThere's a separate talk on how to handle the different ways of iomap()-ing from the driver (Mainly the uncached, write-combining and all that) and how we could detect those to match the driver but that's for another day (If it even matters, I haven't had the time to actually dwelve into it).\nMSIs\nFor MSIs, what I did was find the assigned synthetic PCIe MSI number and I queued the handler with irq_work_queue(). From the safe(r) kernel context where \"pciem_msi_irq_work_func\" gets called it just does \"generic_handle_irq(num)\" which should run all the registered handlers. Which in turn runs the actual PCIe driver's \"pci_irq_handler\".\nSo if your hardware registers a pci_irq_handler it'll work here just fine thanks to this.\nBased on my testing it's completely indistinguishable from a real, hardware-triggered MSI for the driver; but feel free to try and make it explode :)\nDMA\nThe gist of it is to basically setup a communication flow between the userspace proxy that handles kernel&lt;-&gt;proxy&lt;-&gt;QEMU transactions so that when actual DMA needs to happen (Writes from and to DMA allocated buffers) everything gets proxied.\nThe real driver usually does \"dma_alloc_coherent()\" which returns both a virtual address and a physical address (dma_addr_t).\nThose values move across the framework, when QEMU \"initiates\" the DMA it has to ask PCIem to do the reading from the dma_addr_t (Since we can't do that from userspace...), it effectively proxies the DMA request up to the kernel basically.\nPCIem then becomes sort of a \"DMA engine\"; when the IOMMU is off, we're just a phys_to_virt() call away to be able to copy the data directly to the proxy's \"virtual DMA buffer\".\nIf the IOMMU is on, dma_addr_t is an IOVA (I/O Virtual Address), not a physical one. I found out about this doing lots of debugging and observing that the phys address returned by dma_alloc_coherent() being 0xFFFF0000 always (Without amd_iommu=off). Is it some sort of software-controlled trampoline?\nAnyhow, for IOVA handling, I had to loop page-by-page for the DMA's len doing iommy_iova_to_phys() to get the IOMMU to handle the translations for me. Then the phys_to_virt() and subsequent copy_to_user().\nHandling PCI commands\nI had to resort to a poller (Which runs on a kernel thread monitoring for a changed value in the BAR)... yeah, less than optimal but hey, it works!\nI've been experimenting with \"sequential\" ways of handling this, but couldn't figure something that works good enough and doesn't look ugly (I tried memory watchpoints but they apparently don't work on physical addresses which we use for BAR stuff).\npciem_uproxy and pciem's kernel thread\nI would go about and explain how I made a model for communication between the userspace component of pciem and qemu and whatnot but I feel like those parts are actually not-so-interesting; you can freely look at the code for some of the stuff I did to try and avoid race conditions (Not sure I fixed them all but it seems stable from what I can see after leaving DOOM running for a few hours).\nI'd say this is probably (Alongside the polling) the area that should be improved as it'd let me get rid of much of the code I have, but again; we'll see down the road.\nAnyhow, I can get stable output from DOOM and Quake at 640x480@120 (8BPP).\nDOOM\nQuake","id":"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/introducing-pciem/","title":"Introducing PCIem"},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/open-source-ifying-the-visionfive-2/":{"body":"StarFive's VisionFive 2 RISC-V Board\nTrip down the memory lane\nBit of a preface:\nI bought this board somewhere in June 2024; I plugged it in to verify it worked and that was pretty much it; I remember\ninterfacing it through UART and it came with a super custom Debian-based distro on an SD Card. It also came with a 128GB eMMC\nmodule (I had never seen removable eMMC module until that point!) which kinda increased the cool factor for me.\nIt felt super cool to start seeing \"mainstream\" adoption of RISC-V, this new and open-source ISA that had started\npowering electronics all around the globe; but how was the software stack?\nIt was okay...-ish\nLet's start by saying that considering how costly it is to develop the ecosystem, we, the users, can't really expect upstream\nsupport from day one; heck, sometimes even after years in production, products still are closed source and are pretty much destined\nto die off slowly without the help of the Open Source community!\nSo yes, it was okay-ish but it served good; hardware accelerated graphics, external displays, a network stack... It was and still is,\nusable, but we can make it even better.\nThe hardware\nThe VisionFive 2, is powered by a JH7110 SoC, containing 1.5GHz quad-core 64-bit RISC-V Scalar Processor implementing RV64IMAFDCSUZicsr_Zifencei_Zba_Zbb features (It's basically RV64GC plus Zba and Zbb).\nIt has a few other goodies, such as an Imagination GPU and so on; but this are irrelevant for us right now.\nIt's by no means fast, but it doesn't pretend to be; it's sole prupose was/is being an early-adoption board so that the enthusiasts/companies can run their tests on to gauge how it may look like on actual hardware; so that by itself, is quite the feat already.\nAt some point in late '24 the (Supposed) successor to the 7110, the 8100, was mentioned on a Linux Kernel Mailing List; but it hasn't been officially announced/released as of May 2025.\nNow that we understand the basics of our SoC...\nHow much has been already upstreamed?\nI started looking at probably the easiest place to check for mainline support...\nLinux!\nLo-and-behold, there's patches that have already been upstreamed to support the SoC and it's peripherals; as of May 2025 there's still some that haven't\nbeen merged yet (Most important one, being the HDMI controller logic, DRM... and whatnot) and I personally think they probably won't be merged because\nit's been a bit of a while since last activity on patchwork; but you can easily download the patches in .mbox format if needed and apply them manually into\nyour tree.\nI only had to search for a defconfig, thankfully the cool people over at StarFive already have a Linux tree with one (starfive_visionfive2_defconfig), clone the project and target that config; it all compiled fine and booted first try. All the major things I mainly need the board to have working (Ethernet, NVME, SD Slot and eMMC), worked first try.\nIt is worth noting I have not personally tried the GPU on it's own (Haven't connected the board to a monitor nor have tested the hardware acceleration, video encoding/decoding...) so if that's a feature you actually need, it's a bit of a mistery for me. I planned on using this as a headless homelab-esque machine to run some stuff on.\nSo there we had it, VF2 board running the latest and greatest Linux version! But... I figured I may as well not stop there...\nVisionFive 2 Boot Process\nRISC-V Machine-mode stage\nNOTE: This may have inaccuracies since I don't work for StarFive, it's based on my personal interpretations and findings/reverse engineering regarding the board whilst doing all the work on it.\nWhen the board powers on, the CPU executes a ZSBL (Zero-stage bootloader) presumably off of an EEPROM or something similar¹, it's read-only and you can't access it's contents because it's unmapped as soon as the rest of the boot chain starts executing; you could probably try sniffing the contents out of it if provided it's not in the die package of the SoC an is located somewhere in the board; but considering the things it does it's probably best just to ignore it since it's unique task is bootstrapping the processor to the next stage (So most probably, boring assembly to do all of this; nothing interesting).\n¹: It's an on-chip diode rom mapped at physical address 0x2a000000\nThen, it jumps to a cut-down u-boot that gets loaded off of flash storage. It's called u-boot SPL (Second Program Loader), it basically exists to provide a bit of a richer environment to run code on; it has a few interesting things bootloader-wise (It can load things off of an SPI NOR/NAND for instance) but not much else; it's task is to bootstrap into OpenSBI to finally enter RISC-V's S (Supervisor) mode and act as a handler for a few \"supervisor\" calls launched from lower privilege levels.\nRISC-V Supervisor-mode stage\nNow we're on supervisor mode thanks to OpenSBI, what happens now is that it tries loading the actual u-boot (Not the cut-down SPL) from the flash and jumps to it.\nThis is where things start getting interesting because it's where the gates really open up to anything; but to keep it simple, we just need to know that u-boot is autoconfigured to load a \"DTB\" (Device Tree Binary, think of it of a much saner ACPI without the x86 ugliness) that contains the board's required information that Linux needs to parse in order to load itself and init the board's components; then Linux and finally jumping to it, but it can do so officially from 3 different places:\neMMC storage\nMicro SD Card\nNVME drive\n(The unofficial way would be to store it on the flash the board has, it's 16MiB after all, but that means you'll need to do some memory juggling because the SPL and the rest of u-boot/OpenSBI have predefined memory ranges on the flash and must not overlap for obvious reasons).\nSo once the boot media is decided, it does the exciting jmp (Or should I say j...?) to Linux.\nIncidentally, Linux also technically runs in S-mode; so we're missing one last stage; current event horizon is as follows:\nRISC-V User-mode stage\nRight after Linux finishes bootstraping all the required things for it, proceeds to setup user-mode registers (CSRs) and delegates the control to the least-privilged mode sometime after loading the required system services. So in a way, Linux kinda lives in 2 separate privilege levels at the same time (Not that different from what you'd see on x86 technically).\nThat's it, that's the full chain.\nThere's been some developments lately that I had been following closely; but that'll also come later.\nUpdating u-boot\nIn a similar fashion as Linux, u-boot also has the VisionFive 2's tidbits upstreamed; so you can pretty much download the source code, compile it and flash it (Both the SPL and u-boot itself) and you'll automatically have a much updated version; no big deal here...\n...except if you want the VisionFive 2 to run UEFI.\nFixing u-boot SPL to boot EDK2\nStarFive employees pointed in the forums that a preview of EDK2 could be installed on our boards. It works well, but there's 2 minor catches for me:\nYou must run their old u-boot fork with the SPL patches to get it to load EDK2\nYou must run their old edk2 fork with VF2 patches\nIt's worth noting that even after 3 days of work I haven't had the time to upgrade the EDK2 version, but this'll do for the meantime (I'm actually working on that as of writing this blog, if I succeed I promise a future entry here!).\nSo I got my hands to work...\n...though I couldn't progress much; apparently for some reason I've not had the time to investigate further (Other than finding the root issue) but the SPL can't figure out the FDT location inside the SPL binary and crashes on NULL address...\nI made what is probably one of my worst hacks ever, I calculate the address in advance and just offset the base address accordingly; this is stupid (It means you have to hexdump the resulting binary searching where the the FDT header is to fix the offset everytime code size changes or different compilers... etc). But hey, it works; once I have the time to investigate this it'll probably end up somewhere in the u-boot code.\nWith this, we have StarFive's EDK2 running again, but I wasn't still satisfied; I wanted to be the one provisioning the board with my own binaries (Not that I don't trust StarFive or things you may be thinking, it's just personal preference purely for the funzies).\nCrying over EDK2 and fixing it\nEDK2 sucks. Literally.\nI cannot withstand how it's organized, but even less, how it's compiled.\nIt's reminiscent of my old days (2014~, I was barely 13 years old) when I started doing Linux kernel hacking to get a more recent version running on an old phone I had that used a MediaTek SoC.\nThey had a custom build system built around the kernel that was outdated by the time I tried to compile it (I even had to download 5~ year old Ubuntu versions at that time, 9.04, to satisfy the scripts...).\n(It's great actually, impressive project; but I wanted to vent).\nSo yeah, expect environment variable shenanigans and lots of trial and error; I've built EDK2 about 100~ times in the weekend I'm writing this entry and yet sometimes I still can't figure out what I'm missing to get it to compile.\nLong story short; to make EDK2 work with my upstreamed u-boot SPL, I've had to update all the device tree information and misc. regarding the board else it wouldn't do anything. You can see the required changes here.\nAt some point EDK2 started booting again so I got all excited...\n...but then it failed again (It always does).\nThis remains to be fixed, but since I personally don't use SDIO/eMMC anymore to boot the board (I just use an NVME I had laying around) I just went in and disabled the MmcDxe from running.\nEDK2 running on updated VisionFive 2 board\nIt's worth noting that I had some issues regarding Linux booting, I had to customize the EFI/BOOT/startup.nsh file a good bit to make it log correctly and so on (Also, to no try and find a initrd in memory failing miserably because I don't have one...).\nDebian sid\nDebian Trixie appears to be supporting the riscv64 arch so I figured, why not building an image out of it? debootstrap it was!\nI built an ext4 image that I simply wrote over a partition on the NVME and Linux took care of it by specifying the root= and rootwait cmdline parameters on startup.nsh.\nBut the end result was, very, very worth it, here's how to do it:\nBuilding a EFI-capable Debian Trixie 13 sid image and adding GRUB\nWe'll start by creating a disk image, making the partitions and formatting them:\nNow, with the disk properly formatted and using GPT scheme, we can proceed to install Debian and chroot to it.\nFirst, we'll mount everything needed:\nNow, we'll install Debian on it...\n...and we'll chroot into it:\nIt's worth noting that, we'll have to compile Linux and get debian packages out of it; you can do so with:\nAnd then just copy the linux-headers*.deb and linux-image*.deb files inside the chroot.\nWe'll now install those packages:\nNow, we'll install some packages that will come in handy:\nLet's also prepare the network interfaces:\nWe're also going to need to add our hostname info, nano the /etc/hosts and under the 127.0.0.1 localhost just add:\nOr whichever hostname you want, really.\nAlso add it to /etc/hostname.\nUser management's turn now, set the root password:\nAnd create your regular user:\nThat's it! We're now missing the proper EFI enablement, GRUB will come to the rescue:\nAs a personal preference, I edit /etc/default/grub and modify GRUB_CMD_LINUX_DEFAULT from \"quiet\" to \"\" to see the boot log.\nWe also need to generate the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file, it's as easy as doing:\nThough this is partly incorrect, just open the resulting file and rename all references to the loopXX medium to nvme0n1. Also change the mount mode from ro to rw if you want a R/W root filesystem (You very much need to).\nWe're set! Exit the chroot, unmount what we mounted at the start and copy the image over to your NVME drive:\nIt's now a good time to resize the root partition to accomodate the entire drive:\nWith this, you can unplug the drive and re-install it back to the VF2. Assuming that you already installed my u-boot and edk2, it'll launch GRUB automatically.\nMay 9 2025 2:11AM in the morning EDK2 and u-boot update\nEDK2-wise\nI've been able to use more recent EDK2 version (Basically, up-to-date).\nThis is the EDK2 base repository with all the changes from upstream until today May 9 2025, and this other one is the one for the EDK2 Platforms.\nI've made a few changes to the JH7110.dsc target description file to accomodate for new EDK2 changes, but all appears to be working just fine (Like the propietary, outdated fork, from StarFive).\nHere's a new screenshot (It's now being built as RELEASE instead of DEBUG!):\nUpstream EDK2 running on updated VisionFive 2 board\nU-boot wise\nSo, I've also been battling with the hack I had to resort to to make U-boot launch EDK2 from flash in SPL mode for the VF2, but even though the config file is as recommended by u-boot themselves, which is either CONFIG_OF_EMBED or CONFIG_OF_SEPARATE (StarFive's downstream fork uses the prior) set to y in starfive_visionfive2_defconfig it still refuses to find the FDT on the SPL image in-memory somehow; not too sure if this is a config mishap or maybe some strange u-boot bug...\nFor now, my cute little hack will do.\nMay 10 2025 3:41AM in the morning EDK2 update\nI've finally got EDK2 firmware menu and boot selector to work for the VF2!
