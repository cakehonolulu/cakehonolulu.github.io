as many more, grew up playing retro videogames on emulators (And the original hardware!): from sprite-based machines, to more complex, 3D-capable monsters.\n\n\nMetal Slug, an impressive 2D game; developed for SNK's Neo-Geo\n\nA few years ago, I started to ask myself how an emulator works; I initially believed it had to be some sort of magic, but at the end of the day, code is just that, code (Technically, you can develop an emulator from an ECE-perspective; look up Verilog or really, any Hardware-Description-Language, but that's beyond the scope for this post).\nWhat is an emulator?\nLet's start by defining what an emulator (Not to be confused with simulator) really is.\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nThe key takeaway here, is the ability to run code that is designed for one system on another one.\nExamples of this could be, running aarch64 code on your shiny new Intel/AMD PC (Playing a videogame designed for Android, for example); the technique Apple employs for their newer M-line of processors (Which are 64-bit ARM chips) but they are able to maintain backwards compatibility to a degree with macOS software designed for their older Intel machines (And doing so in a fast and efficient manner, using Rosetta 2)...\nBut how can we, as individuals, tackle this problem?\nWell, there's lots of ways of doing so.\nTypes of emulation\nThe following paragraph contains information about a type of emulators that have lately emerged; they're more state-of-the-art in comparison with good-old already-existing emulators, it's meant to illustrate, it can be confusing for newbies so you can skip to the HLE vs LLE chapter if you want.\n\nA brief paragraph: As of recent times, a new way to experience retro systems has appeared, not to confuse you, but I'll give a brief explanation as to what FPGA-based emulation is and not.\nFPGAs are integrated circuits whose behaviour can be repgrogrammed at the logic level after manufacturing, they can be programmed using HDL's (Hardware description languages) which goes through a series of steps before getting executed by the development board.\n\n\nThe Xilinx Spartan FPGA\n\nWhat this basically means is, that you can effectively replicate any existing chip on an FPGA.\nIn comparison with traditional emulators (Which, run on top of an operating system), FPGA-based emulators have a bunch of neat advantages due do the nature of the technology itself.\nFor example, operating systems tend not to give you a fine-grained scheduling; let's say your emulator wants to handle keypad inputs; you need to somehow interact with the underlying OS to perform such task, but the OS itself can then assign the priority it sees fitting so the latency (Normally in miliseconds) can fluctuate making accurate emulation really difficult. Worth mentioning, that normally, the more accurate it needs to be, the more power-hungry the emulator will end up.\nFPGAs benefit from the parallelism they can archieve due to their nature, and also can maintain the components clocked much more accurately again, due to their nature; doing so while not requiring as much power as a normal, PC emulator.\nAnyhow, back to the main topic.\nHLE vs LLE\nThere's two ways to understand emulation; and this varies by the level of closeness to the hardware you decide to entangle yourself with.\nLLE\nLLE stands for Low-level Emulation. What this means is, closely replicating the target hardware at the bare-metal level.\nYou must emulate every bit of the system to make it work; that means implementing a CPU core that can execute the foreign instructions; providing an interface for it to send/recieve data to/from peripherals and respecting the timings of all the components to make it as accurate as possible (You can read further on this topic if you look up Cycle Accuracy).\nHLE\nHLE on the other hand, can be understood as a MITM between the target library calls and mapping them to host-compatible ones; let's say we have System A which, somewhere on it's code, does this:\n\nIf we're trying to HLE System A, we need to figure out a way to first, detect that this function is being called (Normally, there's a piece of code responsible for intercepting, for example, syscalls) and instead of executing the target code, executing a function written for the host architecture that archieves the same but without relying on the target-specific hardware details.\nWe could for example, intercept it and call the following code in a PC:\n\nAnd that's the basic principle behind HLE. You also need a way to intercept those library calls; for example, let's say we're interpreting target (System A) CPU instructions, and suddenly, we encounter a syscall instruction.\nLet's assume this syscall instruction in System A works by specifying the syscall type on register A and the required arguments on registers B and C.\nImagine we find this:\n\nThis basically would call syscall number 3 on the syscall table, which, for example, could be our previously explained libGfxInitFramebuffer().\nYou'd then need to detect this behaviour whilst executing the target code, intercept it and redirect execution and adjust the emulation state accordingly (Maybe adjusting cycle count to account for the original length of the syscall function... etc).\nIt's also important to note, that nowadays (Moreso with more recent consoles), there's a trend to mix both LLE and HLE techniques to get thehe benefits of both approaches. There's some components that you can HLE to reduce the processing hurdle of more complex subsystems a machine can have.\nDefining the target\nNow that we finally have laid down the concepts related to emulation; let's find a target that has a CPU that has a relatively easy implementation in software.\nWe'll focus for example on the Amstrad GX4000. A 3rd generation, PAL home console that was launched in the 80s.\n\n\nThe Amstrad GX4000\n\nThe specs are very straightforward; an 8-bit Zilog Z80A at 4 MHz a custom chip that handled sprites, Sound DMAs and Interrupts.\nSound-wise; a 3-channel stereo, AY-3-8912 chip.\nAs for space, 64 KiB of RAM, 16 KiB of Video RAM and 32 KiB of ROM.\nReally simple.\nWe'll focus on CPU emulation and we'll ignore the rest of the peripherals for now.\nEmulation loop\nOnce you find the detailed specs for the machine you want to target; it's time to work.\nThe usual recommendation is to find on the Internet as much documentation as you can; but depending on the target, you may find less stuff; so be prepared to reverse-engineer if needed.\nFor the major players in the market, there's popular resources online that give a very detailed explanation of the entire system; but again, your mileage may vary.\nThe basics for emulating a CPU are, knowing how a CPU works, here's a pretty simple diagram:\n\n\nThe fetch-decode-execute cycle\n\nBasically, we need to fetch data from the memory, decode it and execute it; profit.\n\n\n2 simple steps!\n\nIn all seriousness; it's really that simple¹\n ¹.- Depending on the CPU, it may be less simple (Think of possible address modes, the straightforward-ness of the opcode decoding, the pipeline it may have, the timings...) \nLet's get down\nCPU emulation techniques\nInterpreter\nWe'll start with the more easier type of technique; an Interpreter.\nLet's have some pseudocode explain the rest, we'll do some assumptions that don't map to the real Z80A, to simplify the explanation and the code (We assume opcode size == 1 byte, no addressing modes, no banked register set...):\n\nThis is the skeleton for an emulator; think of the PC (Program Counter, sometimes also called IP, Instruction Pointer) register as a pointer to memory from where we'll read instructions from.\nNormally, the PC then will get incremented by 1 at the end of the opcode processing (But some opcodes that handle PC relocation, such as JUMPs or CALLs may add an offset to it or straight up setting it to a determinate value).\nIn reality, PC will increment sizeof(opcode), but there may be some exceptions to that in some architectures; be always mindful when designing the main loop.\nAnd that's it, you've just designed a primitive interpreter loop.\nThis is one of the many ways to implement the fetch-decode-execute loop; and one of the slowest ones too; think the amount of instructions per second you need to decode and execute in 8MHz's worth of time.\nIt adds up.\nCached Interpreter\nSo far we've covered the basis for an Interpreter; but there's other techniques to gain an advantage, speed-wise.\nFor instance, you could cache the instructions you're translating in blocks so that it alleviates the fetch-decode hotspot a bit; as it'd only need to process it once (Ignoring that code can be self-modifying and in that case you'd need to invalidate and recompile the affected block; but that's for another day).\nDynamic Recompiler\nBy far, one of the most efficient ways to tackle emulation is by developing a Dynamic Recompiler (Just-in-Time compiler); which interprets the target, arch-uncompatible instructions; and translates them to host instructions. For example, Rosetta 2 converts x86_64 instructions to aarch64 ones and runs them in a efficient and fast manner.\nIt's one of the most complex ones, but also, one of the most rewarding ones; there's several challenges to tackle when developing a Dynamic Recompiler; such as deciding how to to the actual recompilation:\nDo we want an emitter that directly translates the instructions? Maybe we want instead to use some sort of IL (Intermediate language) so that a compiler backend (Think, LLVM) can introduce code optimizations and do the translation? How do we handle self-modifying code? And what about register spilling (Imagine targetting an arch that has more registers than your host one, you may need to use some stack trickery or another technique to decide the least used registers and swap them into the host ones as needed)?\nAs you can see, there are many more challenges when trying to go the Dynamic Recompilation route; but it's a really interesting path to go down.\n\n\nA simple JIT diagram, it also needs a cache for the compiled blocks\n\nPeripherals\nThere's also the added challenge of handling peripherals; there's cases where you'll find I/O operations CPU-wise that interact with the peripherals on the system; or some other times, they can be memory-mapped.\nIn any case, there's some food for thought involved into deciding the best way to tackle both of the systems.\nA simple, pseudocode example that explains the memory-mapped approach:\n\nThere's also some other considerations to have; think about how you want to plot graphics; or play audio, or read from a filesystem... there's some design choices to be made in order to properly handle the rest of the system aside from the CPU and presenting it to the user (Or letting him interact with the emulated environment!).\nBonus Track\nAoT\nThere's also a thing called Ahead-of-Time recompilation which, as you have probably already guessed; recompiles the entire target binary before running it to host-compatible machine code.\nIt's not purely emulation, but it's still a form of recompilation; it's incredibly difficult because it shares a problem that Dynamic Recompilators have; self-modifying code. If you AoT recompile a target code but it ends up self modifying, you can end up with some interesting results.\nCredits\nWith all this being said, I hope the reader finds some understanding in what emulation is about!\nFeel free to reach out to me in case you need more resources!\nYou can also join us @ the EmuDev Discord; there's plenty of knowledgeable people that will help you in your journey!\n","id":"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/how-emulators-work/","title":"How Emulators Work?"},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/hugo-to-zola-migration/":{"body":"To blog or to not blog...\nSo... there's some point in time where you, as a software developer, you may face the urge to go on unedited rants regarding whatever project you\nmay be doing/participating.\nThen you somehow think (\"The collective intellect that resteth in our mortal frames.\", \"Our brain\" from now on)...\nCommunication excerpt\n(Our brain) - Hey, it could be cool to write and document for the posteriority whatever niche thing we may be doing right now.\n(Ours) - Hey, yeah!

It also came with a 128GB eMMC\nmodule (I had never seen removable eMMC module until that point!) which kinda increased the cool factor for me.\nIt felt super cool to start seeing \"mainstream\" adoption of RISC-V, this new and open-source ISA that had started\npowering electronics all around the globe; but how was the software stack?\nIt was okay...-ish\nLet's start by saying that considering how costly it is to develop the ecosystem, we, the users, can't really expect upstream\nsupport from day one; heck, sometimes even after years in production, products still are closed source and are pretty much destined\nto die off slowly without the help of the Open Source community!\nSo yes, it was okay-ish but it served good; hardware accelerated graphics, external displays, a network stack... It was and still is,\nusable, but we can make it even better.\nThe hardware\nThe VisionFive 2, is powered by a JH7110 SoC, containing 1.5GHz quad-core 64-bit RISC-V Scalar Processor implementing RV64IMAFDCSUZicsr_Zifencei_Zba_Zbb features (It's basically RV64GC plus Zba and Zbb).\nIt has a few other goodies, such as an Imagination GPU and so on; but this are irrelevant for us right now.\nIt's by no means fast, but it doesn't pretend to be; it's sole prupose was/is being an early-adoption board so that the enthusiasts/companies can run their tests on to gauge how it may look like on actual hardware; so that by itself, is quite the feat already.\nAt some point in late '24 the (Supposed) successor to the 7110, the 8100, was mentioned on a Linux Kernel Mailing List; but it hasn't been officially announced/released as of May 2025.\nNow that we understand the basics of our SoC...\nHow much has been already upstreamed?\nI started looking at probably the easiest place to check for mainline support...\nLinux!\nLo-and-behold, there's patches that have already been upstreamed to support the SoC and it's peripherals; as of May 2025 there's still some that haven't\nbeen merged yet (Most important one, being the HDMI controller logic, DRM... and whatnot) and I personally think they probably won't be merged because\nit's been a bit of a while since last activity on patchwork; but you can easily download the patches in .mbox format if needed and apply them manually into\nyour tree.\nI only had to search for a defconfig, thankfully the cool people over at StarFive already have a Linux tree with one (starfive_visionfive2_defconfig), clone the project and target that config; it all compiled fine and booted first try. All the major things I mainly need the board to have working (Ethernet, NVME, SD Slot and eMMC), worked first try.\nIt is worth noting I have not personally tried the GPU on it's own (Haven't connected the board to a monitor nor have tested the hardware acceleration, video encoding/decoding...) so if that's a feature you actually need, it's a bit of a mistery for me. I planned on using this as a headless homelab-esque machine to run some stuff on.\nSo there we had it, VF2 board running the latest and greatest Linux version! But... I figured I may as well not stop there...\nVisionFive 2 Boot Process\nRISC-V Machine-mode stage\nNOTE: This may have inaccuracies since I don't work for StarFive, it's based on my personal interpretations and findings/reverse engineering regarding the board whilst doing all the work on it.\nWhen the board powers on, the CPU executes a ZSBL (Zero-stage bootloader) presumably off of an EEPROM or something similar¹, it's read-only and you can't access it's contents because it's unmapped as soon as the rest of the boot chain starts executing; you could probably try sniffing the contents out of it if provided it's not in the die package of the SoC an is located somewhere in the board; but considering the things it does it's probably best just to ignore it since it's unique task is bootstrapping the processor to the next stage (So most probably, boring assembly to do all of this; nothing interesting).\n¹: It's an on-chip diode rom mapped at physical address 0x2a000000\nThen, it jumps to a cut-down u-boot that gets loaded off of flash storage. It's called u-boot SPL (Second Program Loader), it basically exists to provide a bit of a richer environment to run code on; it has a few interesting things bootloader-wise (It can load things off of an SPI NOR/NAND for instance) but not much else; it's task is to bootstrap into OpenSBI to finally enter RISC-V's S (Supervisor) mode and act as a handler for a few \"supervisor\" calls launched from lower privilege levels.\n\nRISC-V Supervisor-mode stage\nNow we're on supervisor mode thanks to OpenSBI, what happens now is that it tries loading the actual u-boot (Not the cut-down SPL) from the flash and jumps to it.\nThis is where things start getting interesting because it's where the gates really open up to anything; but to keep it simple, we just need to know that u-boot is autoconfigured to load a \"DTB\" (Device Tree Binary, think of it of a much saner ACPI without the x86 ugliness) that contains the board's required information that Linux needs to parse in order to load itself and init the board's components; then Linux and finally jumping to it, but it can do so officially from 3 different places:\n\neMMC storage\nMicro SD Card\nNVME drive\n\n(The unofficial way would be to store it on the flash the board has, it's 16MiB after all, but that means you'll need to do some memory juggling because the SPL and the rest of u-boot/OpenSBI have predefined memory ranges on the flash and must not overlap for obvious reasons).\nSo once the boot media is decided, it does the exciting jmp (Or should I say j...?) to Linux.\nIncidentally, Linux also technically runs in S-mode; so we're missing one last stage; current event horizon is as follows:\n\nRISC-V User-mode stage\nRight after Linux finishes bootstraping all the required things for it, proceeds to setup user-mode registers (CSRs) and delegates the control to the least-privilged mode sometime after loading the required system services. So in a way, Linux kinda lives in 2 separate privilege levels at the same time (Not that different from what you'd see on x86 technically).\n\nThat's it, that's the full chain.\nThere's been some developments lately that I had been following closely; but that'll also come later.\nUpdating u-boot\nIn a similar fashion as Linux, u-boot also has the VisionFive 2's tidbits upstreamed; so you can pretty much download the source code, compile it and flash it (Both the SPL and u-boot itself) and you'll automatically have a much updated version; no big deal here...\n...except if you want the VisionFive 2 to run UEFI.\nFixing u-boot SPL to boot EDK2\nStarFive employees pointed in the forums that a preview of EDK2 could be installed on our boards. It works well, but there's 2 minor catches for me:\n\nYou must run their old u-boot fork with the SPL patches to get it to load EDK2\nYou must run their old edk2 fork with VF2 patches\n\nIt's worth noting that even after 3 days of work I haven't had the time to upgrade the EDK2 version, but this'll do for the meantime (I'm actually working on that as of writing this blog, if I succeed I promise a future entry here!).\nSo I got my hands to work...\n...though I couldn't progress much; apparently for some reason I've not had the time to investigate further (Other than finding the root issue) but the SPL can't figure out the FDT location inside the SPL binary and crashes on NULL address...\nI made what is probably one of my worst hacks ever, I calculate the address in advance and just offset the base address accordingly; this is stupid (It means you have to hexdump the resulting binary searching where the the FDT header is to fix the offset everytime code size changes or different compilers... etc). But hey, it works; once I have the time to investigate this it'll probably end up somewhere in the u-boot code.\nWith this, we have StarFive's EDK2 running again, but I wasn't still satisfied; I wanted to be the one provisioning the board with my own binaries (Not that I don't trust StarFive or things you may be thinking, it's just personal preference purely for the funzies).\nCrying over EDK2 and fixing it\nEDK2 sucks. Literally.\nI cannot withstand how it's organized, but even less, how it's compiled.\nIt's reminiscent of my old days (2014~, I was barely 13 years old) when I started doing Linux kernel hacking to get a more recent version running on an old phone I had that used a MediaTek SoC.\nThey had a custom build system built around the kernel that was outdated by the time I tried to compile it (I even had to download 5~ year old Ubuntu versions at that time, 9.04, to satisfy the scripts...).\n(It's great actually, impressive project; but I wanted to vent).\nSo yeah, expect environment variable shenanigans and lots of trial and error; I've built EDK2 about 100~ times in the weekend I'm writing this entry and yet sometimes I still can't figure out what I'm missing to get it to compile.\nLong story short; to make EDK2 work with my upstreamed u-boot SPL, I've had to update all the device tree information and misc. regarding the board else it wouldn't do anything. You can see the required changes here.\nAt some point EDK2 started booting again so I got all excited...\n...but then it failed again (It always does).\nThis remains to be fixed, but since I personally don't use SDIO/eMMC anymore to boot the board (I just use an NVME I had laying around) I just went in and disabled the MmcDxe from running.\n\n\nEDK2 running on updated VisionFive 2 board\n\nIt's worth noting that I had some issues regarding Linux booting, I had to customize the EFI/BOOT/startup.nsh file a good bit to make it log correctly and so on (Also, to no try and find a initrd in memory failing miserably because I don't have one...).\nDebian sid\nDebian Trixie appears to be supporting the riscv64 arch so I figured, why not building an image out of it? debootstrap it was!\nI built an ext4 image that I simply wrote over a partition on the NVME and Linux took care of it by specifying the root= and rootwait cmdline parameters on startup.nsh.\nBut the end result was, very, very worth it, here's how to do it:\nBuilding a EFI-capable Debian Trixie 13 sid image and adding GRUB\nWe'll start by creating a disk image, making the partitions and formatting them:\n\nNow, with the disk properly formatted and using GPT scheme, we can proceed to install Debian and chroot to it.\nFirst, we'll mount everything needed:\n\nNow, we'll install Debian on it...\n\n...and we'll chroot into it:\n\nIt's worth noting that, we'll have to compile Linux and get debian packages out of it; you can do so with:\n\nAnd then just copy the linux-headers*.deb and linux-image*.deb files inside the chroot.\n\nWe'll now install those packages:\n\nNow, we'll install some packages that will come in handy:\n\nLet's also prepare the network interfaces:\n\nWe're also going to need to add our hostname info, nano the /etc/hosts and under the 127.0.0.1   localhost just add:\n\nOr whichever hostname you want, really.\nAlso add it to /etc/hostname.\n\nUser management's turn now, set the root password:\n\nAnd create your regular user:\n\nThat's it! We're now missing the proper EFI enablement, GRUB will come to the rescue:\n\nAs a personal preference, I edit /etc/default/grub and modify GRUB_CMD_LINUX_DEFAULT from \"quiet\" to \"\" to see the boot log.\nWe also need to generate the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file, it's as easy as doing:\n\nThough this is partly incorrect, just open the resulting file and rename all references to the loopXX medium to nvme0n1. Also change the mount mode from ro to rw if you want a R/W root filesystem (You very much need to).\nWe're set! Exit the chroot, unmount what we mounted at the start and copy the image over to your NVME drive:\n\nIt's now a good time to resize the root partition to accomodate the entire drive:\n\nWith this, you can unplug the drive and re-install it back to the VF2. Assuming that you already installed my u-boot and edk2, it'll launch GRUB automatically.\nMay 9 2025 2:11AM in the morning EDK2 and u-boot update\nEDK2-wise\nI've been able to use more recent EDK2 version (Basically, up-to-date).\nThis is the EDK2 base repository with all the changes from upstream until today May 9 2025, and this other one is the one for the EDK2 Platforms.\nI've made a few changes to the JH7110.dsc target description file to accomodate for new EDK2 changes, but all appears to be working just fine (Like the propietary, outdated fork, from StarFive).\nHere's a new screenshot (It's now being built as RELEASE instead of DEBUG!):\n\n\nUpstream EDK2 running on updated VisionFive 2 board\n\nU-boot wise\nSo, I've also been battling with the hack I had to resort to to make U-boot launch EDK2 from flash in SPL mode for the VF2, but even though the config file is as recommended by u-boot themselves, which is either CONFIG_OF_EMBED or CONFIG_OF_SEPARATE (StarFive's downstream fork uses the prior) set to y in starfive_visionfive2_defconfig it still refuses to find the FDT on the SPL image in-memory somehow; not too sure if this is a config mishap or maybe some strange u-boot bug...\nFor now, my cute little hack will do.\nMay 10 2025 3:41AM in the morning EDK2 update\nI've finally got EDK2 firmware menu and boot selector to work for the VF2! Woohoo!\nBonus, we can now have GRUB to the loading for us and Debian is now fully EFI-aware!\n\n\nShowcase of the EDK2 firmware menu, boot selection and GRUB booting Debian SID\n\nAn EDK2 firmware menu static:\n\nAll in all, a frustrating-yet-insanely cool experience.\n","id":"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/open-source-ifying-the-visionfive-2/","title":"Pushing VisionFive 2 RISC-V board into 2025"},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/pages/","title":""},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/pages/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/pages/blog/","title":""},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/projects/":{"body":"","id":"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/projects/","title":"Projects"}},"docInfo":{"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/about/":{"body":145,"title":0},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/archive/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/how-emulators-work/":{"body":1111,"title":2},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/hugo-to-zola-migration/":{"body":481,"title":4},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/open-source-ifying-the-visionfive-2/":{"body":1398,"title":7},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/pages/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://cakehonolulu.github.io/projects/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":10},"lang":"English"}
