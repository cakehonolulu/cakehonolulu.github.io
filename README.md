This repository contains the files required to dispatch my statically-generated website.
<br>
<br>
It uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as the SSG and an in-house modified <a href="https://github.com/joeroe/risotto">Risotto</a> theme.

After each commit, the website gets rebuilt and sent to the gh-pages branch for display
