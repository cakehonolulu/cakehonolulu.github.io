<em>StarFive's VisionFive 2 RISC-V Board</em></p>
</div>
<h2 id="trip-down-the-memory-lane">Trip down the memory lane</h2>
<p>Bit of a preface:</p>
<p>I bought this board somewhere in June 2024; I plugged it in to verify it worked and that was pretty much it; I remember
interfacing it through UART and it came with a super custom Debian-based distro on an SD Card. It also came with a 128GB eMMC
module (I had never seen removable eMMC module until that point!) which kinda increased the cool factor for me.</p>
<p>It felt super cool to start seeing "mainstream" adoption of RISC-V, this new and open-source ISA that had started
powering electronics all around the globe; but how was the software stack?</p>
<p>It was <em>okay</em>...<em>-ish</em></p>
<p>Let's start by saying that considering how costly it is to develop the ecosystem, we, the users, can't really expect upstream
support from day one; heck, sometimes even after years in production, products still are closed source and are pretty much destined
to die off slowly without the help of the Open Source community!</p>
<p>So yes, it was okay-ish but it served good; hardware accelerated graphics, external displays, a network stack... It was and <strong>still is</strong>,
usable, but we can make it even better.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>The VisionFive 2, is powered by a JH7110 SoC, containing 1.5GHz quad-core 64-bit RISC-V Scalar Processor implementing <strong>RV64IMAFDCSUZicsr_Zifencei_Zba_Zbb</strong> features (It's basically <strong>RV64GC</strong> plus <strong>Zba</strong> and <strong>Zbb</strong>).</p>
<p>It has a few other goodies, such as an Imagination GPU and so on; but this are irrelevant for us right now.</p>
<p>It's by no means fast, but it doesn't pretend to be; it's sole prupose was/is being an early-adoption board so that the enthusiasts/companies can run their tests on to gauge how it may look like on actual hardware; so that by itself, is quite the feat already.</p>
<p>At some point in late '24 the (Supposed) successor to the 7110, the 8100, was mentioned on a Linux Kernel Mailing List; but it hasn't been officially announced/released as of May 2025.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the basics of our SoC...</p>
<h2 id="how-much-has-been-already-upstreamed">How much has been already upstreamed?</h2>
<p>I started looking at probably the easiest place to check for mainline support...</p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux!</h3>
<p>Lo-and-behold, there's patches that have already been upstreamed to support the SoC and it's peripherals; as of May 2025 there's still some that haven't
been merged yet (Most important one, being the HDMI controller logic, DRM... and whatnot) and I personally think they probably won't be merged because
it's been a bit of a while since last activity on patchwork; but you can easily download the patches in .mbox format if needed and apply them manually into
your tree.</p>
<p>I only had to search for a defconfig, <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/starfive-tech/linux/">thankfully the cool people over at StarFive already have a Linux tree with one</a> (<code>starfive_visionfive2_defconfig</code>), clone the project and target that config; it all compiled fine and booted first try. All the major things I mainly need the board to have working (Ethernet, NVME, SD Slot and eMMC), worked first try.</p>
<p>It is worth noting I have not personally tried the GPU on it's own (Haven't connected the board to a monitor nor have tested the hardware acceleration, video encoding/decoding...) so if that's a feature you actually need, it's a bit of a mistery for me. I planned on using this as a headless homelab-esque machine to run some stuff on.</p>
<p>So there we had it, VF2 board running the latest and greatest Linux version! But... I figured I may as well not stop there...</p>
<h2 id="visionfive-2-boot-process">VisionFive 2 Boot Process</h2>
<h3 id="risc-v-machine-mode-stage">RISC-V Machine-mode stage</h3>
<p><em>NOTE: This may have inaccuracies since I don't work for StarFive, it's based on my personal interpretations and findings/reverse engineering regarding the board whilst doing all the work on it.</em></p>
<p>When the board powers on, the CPU executes a ZSBL (Zero-stage bootloader) <del>presumably off of an EEPROM or something similar</del>¹, it's read-only and you can't access it's contents because it's unmapped as soon as the rest of the boot chain starts executing; you could probably try sniffing the contents out of it if provided it's not in the die package of the SoC an is located somewhere in the board; but considering the things it does it's probably best just to ignore it since it's unique task is bootstrapping the processor to the next stage (So most probably, boring assembly to do all of this; nothing interesting).</p>
<p>¹: <a rel="external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/s/s5WNFeJe3h">It's an on-chip diode rom mapped at physical address 0x2a000000</a></p>
<p>Then, it jumps to a cut-down u-boot that gets loaded off of flash storage. It's called <strong>u-boot SPL</strong> (<strong>S</strong>econd <strong>P</strong>rogram <strong>L</strong>oader), it basically exists to provide a bit of a richer environment to run code on; it has a few interesting things bootloader-wise (It can load things off of an SPI NOR/NAND for instance) but not much else; it's task is to bootstrap into OpenSBI to finally enter RISC-V's S (<strong>S</strong>upervisor) mode and act as a handler for a few "supervisor" calls launched from lower privilege levels.</p>

<h3 id="risc-v-supervisor-mode-stage">RISC-V Supervisor-mode stage</h3>
<p>Now we're on supervisor mode thanks to OpenSBI, what happens now is that it tries loading the actual u-boot (Not the cut-down SPL) from the flash and jumps to it.</p>
<p>This is where things start getting interesting because it's where the gates really open up to anything; but to keep it simple, we just need to know that u-boot is autoconfigured to load a "DTB" (<strong>D</strong>evice <strong>T</strong>ree <strong>B</strong>inary, think of it of a <strong>much</strong> saner ACPI without the x86 ugliness) that contains the board's required information that Linux needs to parse in order to load itself and init the board's components; then Linux and finally jumping to it, but it can do so <em>officially</em> from 3 different places:</p>
<ul>
<li>eMMC storage</li>
<li>Micro SD Card</li>
<li>NVME drive</li>
</ul>
<p>(The unofficial way would be to store it on the flash the board has, it's 16MiB after all, but that means you'll need to do some memory juggling because the SPL and the rest of u-boot/OpenSBI have predefined memory ranges on the flash and must not overlap for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>So once the boot media is decided, it does the exciting <code>jmp</code> (Or should I say <code>j</code>...?) to Linux.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Linux also <em>technically</em> runs in S-mode; so we're missing one last stage; current event horizon is as follows:</p>
<pre class="mermaid bg-inherit">

</pre>
<h3 id="risc-v-user-mode-stage">RISC-V User-mode stage</h3>
<p>Right after Linux finishes bootstraping all the required things for it, proceeds to setup user-mode registers (CSRs) and delegates the control to the least-privilged mode sometime after loading the required system services. So in a way, Linux <em>kinda</em> lives in 2 separate privilege levels at the same time (Not that different from what you'd see on x86 <em>technically</em>).</p>

<p>That's it, that's the full chain.</p>
<p>There's been some developments lately that I had been following closely; but that'll also come later.</p>
<h2 id="updating-u-boot">Updating u-boot</h2>
<p>In a similar fashion as Linux, u-boot also has the VisionFive 2's tidbits upstreamed; so you can pretty much download the source code, compile it and flash it (Both the SPL and u-boot itself) and you'll automatically have a much updated version; no big deal here...</p>
<p>...except if you want the VisionFive 2 to run UEFI.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-u-boot-spl-to-boot-edk2">Fixing u-boot SPL to boot EDK2</h2>
<p>StarFive employees pointed in the forums that a preview of EDK2 could be installed on our boards. It works well, but there's 2 minor catches for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must run their old u-boot fork with the SPL patches to get it to load EDK2</li>
<li>You must run their old edk2 fork with VF2 patches</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that even after 3 days of work I haven't had the time to upgrade the EDK2 version, but this'll do for the meantime (I'm actually working on that as of writing this blog, if I succeed I promise a future entry here!).</p>
<p>So I got my hands to work...</p>
<p>...though I couldn't progress much; apparently for some reason I've not had the time to investigate further (Other than finding the root issue) but the SPL can't figure out the FDT location inside the SPL binary and crashes on NULL address...</p>
<p>I made what is <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/cakehonolulu/u-boot_vf2/commit/7c47c5c85bd0db430deae63eeb56bcd7cdbf0f0e#diff-434931895d55117620bd7f8ab9f55ada1d4510572a9750b6d13e985d93548bfaR778">probably one of my worst hacks ever</a>, I calculate the address in advance and just offset the base address accordingly; this is stupid (It means you have to <code>hexdump</code> the resulting binary searching where the the FDT header is to fix the offset everytime code size changes or different compilers... etc). But hey, it works; once I have the time to investigate this it'll probably end up somewhere in the u-boot code.</p>
<p>With this, we have StarFive's EDK2 running again, but I wasn't still satisfied; I wanted to be the one provisioning the board with my own binaries (Not that I don't trust StarFive or things you may be thinking, it's just personal preference purely for the funzies).</p>
<h2 id="crying-over-edk2-and-fixing-it">Crying over EDK2 and fixing it</h2>
<p>EDK2 sucks. Literally.</p>
<p>I cannot withstand how it's organized, but even less, how it's compiled.</p>
<p>It's reminiscent of my old days (2014~, I was barely 13 years old) when I started doing Linux kernel hacking to get a more recent version running on an old phone I had that used a MediaTek SoC.</p>
<p>They had a custom build system built around the kernel that was outdated by the time I tried to compile it (I even had to download 5~ year old Ubuntu versions at that time, 9.04, to satisfy the scripts...).</p>
<p><em>(It's great actually, impressive project; but I wanted to vent).</em></p>
<p>So yeah, expect environment variable <em>shenanigans</em> and lots of trial and error; I've built EDK2 about 100~ times in the weekend I'm writing this entry and yet sometimes I still can't figure out what I'm missing to get it to compile.</p>
<p>Long story short; to make EDK2 work with my upstreamed u-boot SPL, I've had to update all the device tree information and misc. regarding the board else it wouldn't do anything. You can see the required changes <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/starfive-tech/edk2-platforms/commit/523d36a471dc7f7238176330e4cd38ebfa1e623a">here</a>.</p>
<p>At some point EDK2 started booting again so I got all excited...</p>
<p>...but then it failed again (It always does).</p>
<p>This remains to be fixed, but since I personally don't use SDIO/eMMC anymore to boot the board (I just use an NVME I had laying around) I just went in and <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/starfive-tech/edk2-platforms/commit/02294fd40e46378b8050f8a0c19ffafcf7a8d6f5">disabled the MmcDxe from running</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>It's worth noting that I had some issues regarding Linux booting, I had to customize the <code>EFI/BOOT/startup.nsh</code> file a good bit to make it log correctly and so on (Also, to no try and find a initrd in memory failing miserably because I don't have one...).</p>
<h2 id="debian-sid">Debian sid</h2>
<p>Debian Trixie appears to be supporting the <code>riscv64</code> arch so I figured, why not building an image out of it? <code>debootstrap</code> it was!</p>
<p>I built an ext4 image that I simply wrote over a partition on the NVME and Linux took care of it by specifying the <code>root=</code> and <code>rootwait</code> cmdline parameters on <code>startup.nsh</code>.</p>
<p>But the end result was, very, very worth it, here's how to do it:</p>
<h2 id="building-a-efi-capable-debian-trixie-13-sid-image-and-adding-grub">Building a EFI-capable Debian Trixie 13 sid image and adding GRUB</h2>
<p>We'll start by creating a disk image, making the partitions and formatting them:</p>

<p>Now, with the disk properly formatted and using GPT scheme, we can proceed to install Debian and chroot to it.</p>

<p>We're also going to need to add our hostname info, <code>nano</code> the <code>/etc/hosts</code> and under the <code>127.0.0.1   localhost</code> just add:</p>

<p>Or whichever hostname you want, really.</p>
<p>Also add it to <code>/etc/hostname</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>User management's turn now, set the root password:</p>

<p>That's it! We're now missing the proper EFI enablement, GRUB will come to the rescue:</p>
<pre class="giallo z-code"><code data-lang="shellscript"><span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-entity z-name">root@RYZEN5:/#</span><span class="z-string"> apt install grub-efi</span></span>

<p>As a personal preference, I edit <code>/etc/default/grub</code> and modify <code>GRUB_CMD_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> from <code>"quiet"</code> to <code>""</code> to see the boot log.</p>
<p>We also need to generate the <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> file, it's as easy as doing:</p>
<pre class="giallo z-code"><code data-lang="shellscript"><span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-entity z-name">root@RYZEN5:/#</span><span class="z-string"> grub-mkconfig</span><span class="z-constant z-other"> -o</span><span class="z-string"> /boot/grub/grub.cfg</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Though this is partly incorrect, just open the resulting file and rename all references to the <code>loopXX</code> medium to <code>nvme0n1</code>. Also change the mount mode from <code>ro</code> to <code>rw</code> if you want a R/W root filesystem (You very much need to).</p>
<p>We're set! Exit the chroot, unmount what we mounted at the start and copy the image over to your NVME drive:</p>
<pre class="giallo z-code"><code data-lang="shellscript"><span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-entity z-name">$</span><span class="z-string"> sudo dd</span><span class="z-constant z-character"> \</span></span>

<p>With this, you can unplug the drive and re-install it back to the VF2. Assuming that you already installed my u-boot and edk2, it'll launch GRUB automatically.</p>
<h2 id="may-9-2025-2-11am-in-the-morning-edk2-and-u-boot-update">May 9 2025 2:11AM in the morning EDK2 and u-boot update</h2>
<h3 id="edk2-wise">EDK2-wise</h3>
<p>I've been able to use more recent EDK2 version (Basically, up-to-date).</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="https://github.com/cakehonolulu/edk2_vf2">This</a> is the EDK2 base repository with all the changes from upstream until today May 9 2025, and <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/cakehonolulu/edk2-platforms_vf2">this other one</a> is the one for the EDK2 Platforms.</p>
<p>I've made a few changes to the JH7110.dsc target description file to accomodate for new EDK2 changes, but all appears to be working just fine (Like the propietary, outdated fork, from StarFive).</p>
<p>Here's a new screenshot (It's now being built as <code>RELEASE</code> instead of <code>DEBUG</code>!):</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<h3 id="u-boot-wise">U-boot wise</h3>
<p>So, I've also been battling with the hack I had to resort to to make U-boot launch EDK2 from flash in SPL mode for the VF2, but even though the config file is as <a rel="external" href="https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/develop/devicetree/control.html">recommended by u-boot themselves</a>, which is either <code>CONFIG_OF_EMBED</code> or <code>CONFIG_OF_SEPARATE</code> (StarFive's downstream fork uses the prior) set to <code>y</code> in <code>starfive_visionfive2_defconfig</code> it still refuses to find the FDT on the SPL image in-memory somehow; not too sure if this is a config mishap or maybe some strange u-boot bug...</p>
<p>For now, my cute little hack will do.</p>
<h2 id="may-10-2025-3-41am-in-the-morning-edk2-update">May 10 2025 3:41AM in the morning EDK2 update</h2>
<p>I've finally got EDK2 firmware menu and boot selector to work for the VF2! Woohoo!</p>
<p>Bonus, we can now have GRUB to the loading for us and Debian is now fully EFI-aware!</p>

<p>All in all, a frustrating-yet-insanely cool experience.</p>
