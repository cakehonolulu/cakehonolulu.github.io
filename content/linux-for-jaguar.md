## What in the tarnation is an Atari Jaguar?

Released in North America in November of 1993, the Atari Jaguar promised to be the new cool kid in the block thanks to it's (Highly debated) 64 bits of pure power.

The console itself ended up being a commercial disaster, even after the release of the CD addon, the Jaguar CD; which managed to sell even less units in a desperate attempt to try and compete with the Sony Playstation and the Sega Saturn.

## Why in the tarnation Linux of all things?

Interestingly enough, to this day, Linux has architecture code for the 68000-family of processors. 68040, 68030, 68010... and even the original base 68000 processor. All neatly structured under ```arch/m68k/```.

As a refresher, the Motorola 68000 was a CISC processor with mixed 16-32 bit capabilities (It's usually described as being 32-bit internally due to the register width length and 16-bit because the data bus was 16-bit, so 2-byte transfers at a time).

It had a 24-bit address bus, 2 to the power 24; thereabout a maximum of 16MBs of addressable memory.

It was released on 1979 to compete with the soon-to-be-released 16-bit CPUs of the era.

Overall, it got lots of traction commercially; it ended up being incoporated in lots of popular commercial hardware. Biggest contenders are the original Macintosh (And Apple Lisa), the Commodore Amiga series of computers (With varying generations of the 68000), the Sega Genesis/Megadrive, the Neo-Geo AES, Plexus workstations... and the Jaguar.

Let's now address the elephant in the room, why Linux.

Well, it's easy; `because we can` (_-ish_).

## jmp _linux?

Doing a bringup for a new 68000-based Linux port should be easy... right? Well... you're in for a good time.

As you may know (Or not), there's an extended thought that Linux requires an MMU to run (You know, being able to use virtual memory is a good thing if we want to run software w/o having day-long headaches).

Technically you are _kind of_ right, but there's *uClinux*; which precisely makes this feasible. At some point it stopped being a downstream fork of Linux to become part of it; thankfully it's baked in for `m68k` (And well, the flat memory model and the rest of requirements you can imagine that an MMU-less system has).

Okay so, we enable all the required configuration flags on the Linux [`menuconfig`](https://github.com/cakehonolulu/linux_jag/commit/7b769c4bfa748f689463ba4d53eecc811c7d42f2) (To basically tell it not to use an MMU and use the [Flat Memory model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_memory_model)), we compile and it should run right? Well yes... but no.

## What actually jmp _linux involves

The Jaguar has 2 megabytes of RAM (Mapped at 0x000000), (up to) 6 megabytes of ROM (The cartridge, basically) mapped at 0x80000 and 2 custom ICs (Tom & Jerry, a "GPU" and a DSP) which are also memory-mapped. 

The main hurdle we have is the memory footprint; while it's true that it's a good amount, it's still not infinite (We're talking megabytes, not _gigabytes_).

We basically need to find a way to try and optimize our RAM usage. We can do the easy things first, removing features from the kernel, disabling debug... the usual suspects; but we'll still probably have the issue where we can't load the kernel to RAM w/o going OOM (Heck, we're not even considering an initramfs at this point, which are also bulky).

Thankfully, Linux is smart enough to let us "split" the kernel in 2 separate memory regions. One can take advantage of the fact that we can store the read-only sections of it (Think, `.rodata` or `.text`) on the cartidge (The ROM) and the dynamic sections (`.data` or `.bss`) in RAM (Think, `XIP`; [eXecute-In-Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execute_in_place)).

Fortunately for us, it's a matter of telling it where we have the RAM, and where we have the ROM and it (Liunx) handles the relocations for us.

Cool, we can now fit Linux on the Jaguar and it should be able to execute... right? Well sure, you can try specifying the base of the kernel (Remember, `non-PIC` code) and loading it there and just doing a `jmp $80000`... but how do we know what is happening under the hood?

## What Linux needs to boot

In the context of booting Linux, we need 2 things (At least, when doing the bringup):

* Any type of output so we can see kernel messages
* Any way to tick the system (A timer, basically)

The first requisite usually involves `ye' good ol'` UART. The Jaguar's DSP (Jerry) has TXD & RXD pins that (At least for booting Linux) can be repurposed to do serial output (If we ignore anything that has to do with sound). Writing a small console driver that bitbangs the pins is enough to start seeing some `earlyprintk` messages.

The second one, is a bit tougher. But we can basically use any of the 2 timers that the Jerry IC has; commercial games & software use them for sound-related tasks but we'll use them to basically enable Linux to calibrate and setup the scheduler and the systems that also depend on a `PIT`. It's useful that they can both trigger an interrupt on the Jerry itself but also on the 68000. We can basically override the board-specific init of the 68000 on Linux and designate that as the PIT that Linux will use from now on.

We compile, we try to run...

...

Nothing?

Okay... that's strange; we should be getting something? I mean, everything checks out... kernel config: check... addresses: check... compiler... compiler?

Turns out that the bundled `m68k-linux-` cross compiler on Ubuntu repositories emits unaligned memory accesses (Even after passing `-68000`) so it was, effectively, crashing (Since the base 68000 doesn't implement unaligned memory access handling).

Using a compiler built from sources specifically targetting `m68k-elf-` for the 68000 seems to fix this, but it's definitely a strange thing.

This also points out a separate problem; since our ROM isn't mapped at 0x00000 but 0x80000, the 68000 tries jumping to VBR (0x0) and since there's no handlers there it basically eats itself and burns down. This needed a separate `memcpy` of the so-called `vectors` to the base of RAM to fix in the Jaguar platform-specific Linux code.

Cool, we get now finally get _some_ output:

```

```

Now it tries to find and execute an `init` process... which we don't have... so it crashes again.

## Userspace

One of the many limitations we have is, since we can't use ELF files (We use FLAT binaries, mainly due to the `nommu` situation); so this complicates our toolchain setup a bit.

I wasn't really able to find ways to compile `elf2flt` (The utility that basically converts from one format to the other) in a standalone way, it basically needs you to provide some `.a` and some `.h` files (Related to `libiberty` and akin) and those seem to have vanished from default configurations of `binutils`+`gcc` for the 68000... but strangely, `buildroot` seems to have had a recent update where they figured it all out for us for the base 68000.

<div style="text-align: center;">

![Buildroot](https://cakehonolulu.github.io/images/linux_jaguar/buildroot.png)
</div>

Kudos to the [`linuxmd`](https://github.com/LinuxMD/) project, the [patch to enable m68k nommu](https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/commit/e5c7b43494c4d6aa57c6ef314bd4e636aacc14fc) is dated May 2026 (So as of writing this blog, 2 months old!)

So I basically had it do the thing for me and also decided to go for `busybox` which was one of the few (If not only) project of this kind that supports a `nommu` target.

There were some issues (Mostly related to me not having dealt with flat binaries ever) but again, nothing a few minutes of debugging and logging wouldn't fix. The most glaring issue I was having was OOM issues everywhere when trying to execute init. I basically just did this:

```
❯ cat ~/jagfs/rootfs/init 
#!/bin/busybox sh

/bin/busybox sh

❯ 
```

Usually you ask `busybox` to populate the rest of the utilities (It's just symlinks to itself, with different names; what they call the `applet` design where based on `argv[1]` it knows which applet to dispatch: `echo`, `ls`, `cat`...), but for some reason that was OOMing the kernel; so it's just `sh` for now (The `shebang` part also gets executed but seems not to eat up all the memory like `--install` does).

We now have a rootfs, we pack it as `cpio` and embed it into the `vmlinux` image itself... and voila!

As an exercise left to the reader, there's a few interesting tidbits that you can basically check on Linux in regards of FLAT binaries (F.e, there's different ways of handling the execution of them: Load the entire binary to RAM, do GOT/PLT relocation... all of which can be checked with `flthdr`).

```
❯ flthdr ~/jagfs/rootfs/bin/busybox

    Reloc Start:  0x25808
    Reloc Count:  0x100e
    Flags:        0x1 ( Load-to-Ram )
```

Pretty nifty thing...

There's a separate tune we had to do on the toolchain's `libc` (Which is `uClibc`) that involves modiyfing the malloc strategy to `malloc-simple`; else the metadata associated with faster and smarter allocations eat up our memory very fast and we'd panic again.

This memory allocation change was done within `buildroot`'s `uClibC` menuconfig.

</div>

I also got some time to implement a simple Tom (GPU but not a GPU, more like word/object processor & blitter) console driver so this can be tested on real hardware too.

Don't forget that if you run on real hardware, the converted-to-binary `vmlinux` (Using `objcopy`) needs to be compiled at a fixed offset from 0x80000 so that the Jaguar cart header can be added (Which in turn, jumps to whichever location you say it to). So you need to add an offset of 8KB to `CONFIG_ROM_START`, `CONFIG_ROM_LENGTH` (Which will be a bit smaller due to the increase in base address), `CONFIG_ROMVEC` and `CONFIG_ROMSTART`.

The basic idea to replicate the setup is, compile buildroot targetting the 68000 (With the `malloc` strategy changed). You can ask it to build busybox with a custom `.config` file path (Provided at end of post) so it'll get you the FLAT binary. You then populate a simple initramfs file structure (There's resources online on what you need to do, usually involves creating `/{dev,bin,usr,sbin...}` directories and adding some `mknode` magic to `/dev/` to prop up the `/dev/console/` nodes plus an `init` script; which is also provided at the end of this post).

Then you tell Linux where you have your newly-built `initramfs.cpio` file and voilà!

That's it!

In contrast with `linuxmd`, we don't have special cartridge mappers (`SSF2`, which gives an extra 4MBs of RAM on the MegaDruve) so I couldn't really justify (Memory-wise) adding any bootloader (`u-boot`, for instance) so I basically went with the approach I documented on the blog (Of basically doing `jmp _linux`).
