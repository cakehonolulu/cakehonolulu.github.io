<br>

My name is Joel and I am a Software Developer.

I'm currently studying a Computer Science degree at [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu/); I switched degrees in 2022 (I was previously enrolled at [Universitat Rovira i Virgili](https://www.urv.cat/)'s Web and Mobile app development degree; but decided to revamp my career path).

# My story

<br>

My passion for computers started early on in my life; thanks to my dad, who introduced me to the fascinating world of PCs, from hardware, to retro or modern software; I have a sweet spot for everything.

I vividly remember taking what I now know, were really simple classes, about computers in my infant school years. They let us experiment with really old (Windows 3.11-old) games for kids and I kept enjoying computers throughout the years.

My first pieces of "code" were simple Windows Batch scripts that had colorful TUIs, not just text, but text-based, MS-DOS-esque UIs. It was fun; but I didn't take much to go to a bit more powerful stuff.

I stumbed upon Visual Basic, which was my first, more mature encounter, with a programming language.

On my teens I kept learning loads of new stuff; at some point I became hyper-fixated at the Android Operating System; where I was able to upgrade the version for the phone I had at that time whose manufacturer gave up support. It made me start dwelving into what I enjoy the most; hardware and low-level. From debugging a hard-rebooting Linux Kernel using UART, to countless hours compiling, reverse engineering parts of the AOSP source to fit the device I had (I even had to create a kernel source from scratch reverse engineering device drivers only with the prebuilt kernel that they sjipped the device with)... An overall enriching experience I must say.

Then slowly but steadily, came pretty much the rest of the knowledge I have. I started learning more state-of-the-art skills, dwelved into more sophisticated CS terms and eventually (I have to admit that primarly thanks to a teacher at my first university who I'll remember all my life) I decided to risk it all, switch degrees (For an online one) and land myself a job.

Overall, I enjoy everything related to CS; I profoundly think this is *the* passion I'll dedicate my life on.

That being said...
