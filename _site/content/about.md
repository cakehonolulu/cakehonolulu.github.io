My name is Joel and I am a Spanish Software Developer that has loved everything-computers since I can remember.

I'm always passionate about what I do, be it web development (Front, or back end), pure software developent (High or low level) or any other code-related task; if it's programmable, chances are that I'll love it.

If you want to further connect with me, don't hesitate to use any of the paths below:

* [Personal Blog](https://cakehonolulu.github.io)
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-bueno-calvache)
* Email: cakehonolulu@protonmail.com

Even though I started a 3-year University Degree called GTDAWIM @ Universitat Rovira i Virgili (Web and mobile app development), I'm currently enrolled on a 4-year Computer Science degree @ Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

The reasoning behind the change is that I love computers in general and I thought that I'd be loosing an important part of their quirks if I only learned Web/Mobile app development.

Aso, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya is one of the first universities that lets you have your own, customized schedule so that you can also work on a company in the meantime; on the other hand, my plan is to continue improving my programming skills and expanding my knowledge!

I have a *really* high interest towards Cybersecurity, that's why I plan on getting a Master's degree as sonn as I finish my current degree.
